            <hr>
            <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose
                programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy
                emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
                object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
                projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often
                described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                <br>
                <br>
                Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000,
                introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.
                <br>
                <br>
                Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely
                backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.The Python 2 language
                was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18
                is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release."

            <h6 class="display-4">History</h6>
            <br>
            <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
                Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
                in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),capable of
                exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.Its implementation began in
                December 1989.Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer,
                until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's
                Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term
                commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.He now shares his leadership as a member of a
                five-person steering council.
                <br><br></p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col col-lg-8 lead" style="text-align: justify;">
                    In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw,
                    Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to
                    lead the project.Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including
                    a cycle-detecting
                    garbage collector and support for Unicode.Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major
                    revision of the language that is not
                    completely backward-compatible.Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6. and
                    2.7.x version series.
                    <br><br>
                    Releases of Python 3 include the 2 to 3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the
                    translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015
                    then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a
                    large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.

                    In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw,
                    Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to
                    lead the project.Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including
                    a cycle-detecting
                    garbage collector and support for Unicode.Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major
                    revision of the language that is not
                    completely backward-compatible.Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6. and
                    2.7.x version series.
                    <br><br>
                    Releases of Python 3 include the 2 to 3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the
                    translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015
                    then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a
                    large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.

                    Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly
                    extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding
                    programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with
                    a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC,
                    which espoused the opposite approach.Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar
                    while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology.

                    In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should
                    be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it" design philosophy.
                    Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that "To
                    describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."Python's
                    developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts
                    of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of
                    clarity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules
                    written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is
                    also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the
                    Python interpreter.An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is
                    reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in
                    occasionally playful
                    approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from
                    a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.

                    Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it
                    often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it
                    does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has
                    fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.
                    Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An
                    increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end
                    of the current block.Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's
                    semantic structure.This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other
                    languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn't have any semantic meaning.Despite being
                    dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for
                    example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.

                    Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for
                    object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for
                    example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an
                    instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.

                    Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.The syntax of both
                    styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or
                    indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of
                    Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were
                    eliminated in Python 3.0.
                    The long term plan is to support gradual typing and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language
                    allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An
                    experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.
